# CoderDOJO - Image Jutsu

The Image Jutsu is a series of Jupyter Notebook that explain that images are just matrices of RGB triples without using the word *matrix*. It is in Czech language.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

You need Python3 and Jupyter Notebook. Then go to your directory with CoderDOJO projects and do
```
git clone https://github.com/popelucha/coderdojo.git
```

### Installing

No installation is needed if you can run Jupyter Notebook. Either click on an icon (in Windows Python Distribution Anaconda) or write in the command line in the terminal:

```
jupyter-notebook
```

Everything else will happen in the browser window. In case you don't have the **pillow** package installed, run

```
pip3 install --user pillow
```
